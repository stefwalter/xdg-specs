2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: a desktop file of type Application should
	always have an Exec key. Same for Link Type and URL key.

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: desktop files of type Directory have a
	.directory extension right now (at least in GNOME), but according to
	the spec, this is wrong. The patch fixes this. Also, it removes a
	small part of text explaining the name of a desktop file describing a
	directory.

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml:clarify a bit the text about keys that only
	makes sense in a specific context. Also, state that the keys should
	not be used outside of this context. For example, the URL key should
	not be present if the type is not Link.

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: small typo

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: this changes the type of the version from
	numeric to string. It's needed if we consider the possibility that
	there are some desktop entry files out there using 0.9.x as a value
	for this key. The change doesn't break anything.

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: UnmountIcon is a localestring key.

2007-04-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* desktop-entry-spec.xml: clarify that lists should always end with a
	semicolon, even if there's only one value.
