    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      Both the KDE and GNOME desktop environments have adopted a similar
      format for "desktop entries", or configuration files describing how a
      particular program is to be launched, how it appears in menus, etc.
      It is to the larger community's benefit that a unified standard be
      agreed upon by all parties such that interoperation between the two
      environments, and indeed any additional environments that implement
      the specification, becomes simpler.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="basic-format">
    <title>Basic format of the file</title>
    <para>
      Desktop entry files should have the <filename>.desktop</filename>
      extension, except for files of <varname>Type</varname>
      <constant>Directory</constant> which should have the
      <filename>.directory</filename> extension. Determining file type on basis
      of extension makes determining the file type very easy and quick.
      When no file extension is present, the desktop system should
      fall back to recognition via "magic detection".
    </para>
    <para>
      For applications, the part of the name of the desktop file (before the <filename>.desktop</filename>)
      should follow the "reverse DNS" convention, e.g. <literal>org.example.FooViewer.desktop</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Desktop entry files are encoded in UTF-8. A file is interpreted as a
      series of lines that are separated by linefeed characters. Case is
      significant everywhere in the file.
    </para>
    <para>
      Compliant implementations MUST not remove any fields from the file,
      even if they don't support them.  Such fields must be maintained in a
      list somewhere, and if the file is "rewritten", they will be included.
      This ensures that any desktop-specific extensions will be preserved
      even if another system accesses and changes the file.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="comments">
      <title>Comments</title>
    <para>
      Lines beginning with a <literal>#</literal> and blank lines are
      considered comments and will be ignored, however they should be
      preserved across reads and writes of the desktop entry file.
    </para>
    <para>
      Comment lines are uninterpreted and may contain any character
      (except for LF). However, using UTF-8 for comment lines that
      contain characters not in ASCII is encouraged.
    </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="group-header">
      <title>Group headers</title>
      <para>
	A group header with name <literal>groupname</literal> is a line in the
	format:
      </para>
      <programlisting>[groupname]</programlisting>
      <para>
	Group names may contain all ASCII characters except for
	<literal>[</literal> and <literal>]</literal> and control characters.
      </para>
      <para>
	Multiple groups may not have the same name.
      </para>
      <para>
	All <literal>{key,value}</literal> pairs following a group header until
	a new group header belong to the group.
      </para>
      <para>
	The basic format of the desktop entry file requires that there be
	a group header named <literal>Desktop Entry</literal>.  There may
	be other groups present in the file, but this is the most
	important group which explicitly needs to be supported.  This
	group should also be used as the "magic key" for automatic MIME
	type detection.  There should be nothing preceding this group in
	the desktop entry file but possibly one or more comments.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="entries">
      <title>Entries</title>
      <para>
	Entries in the file are <literal>{key,value}</literal> pairs in the
	format:
      </para>
      <programlisting>Key=Value</programlisting>
      <para>
	Space before and after the equals sign should be ignored; the
	<literal>=</literal> sign is the actual delimiter.
      </para>
      <para>
	Only the characters <literal>A-Za-z0-9-</literal> may be used in
	key names.
      </para>
      <para>
	As the case is significant, the keys <varname>Name</varname> and
	<varname>NAME</varname> are not equivalent.
      </para>
      <para>
	Multiple keys in the same group may not have the same name. Keys in
	different groups may have the same name.
      </para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="value-types">
    <title>Possible value types</title>
    <para>
      The value types recognized are <literal>string</literal>,
      <literal>localestring</literal>,
      <literal>boolean</literal>, and
      <literal>numeric</literal>.
    </para>

      <listitem>
       <para>

       </para>
      </listitem>

    <para>
      The escape sequences <literal>\s</literal>, <literal>\n</literal>,
      <literal>\t</literal>, <literal>\r</literal>, and
      <literal>\\</literal> are supported for values of type
      <literal>string</literal> and <literal>localestring</literal>, meaning
      ASCII space, newline, tab, carriage return, and backslash, respectively.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some keys can have multiple values. In such a case, the value of the key
      is specified as a plural: for example, <literal>string(s)</literal>. The
      multiple values should be separated by a semicolon, and the value of the
      key should have a semicolon as trailing character. Semicolons in these
      values need to be escaped using <literal>\;</literal>.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="localized-keys">
    <title>Localized values for keys</title>
    <para>
	  Keys  with type <literal>localestring</literal> may be postfixed by
	  [<replaceable>LOCALE</replaceable>],
	  where <replaceable>LOCALE</replaceable> is the locale type of the
	  entry.  <replaceable>LOCALE</replaceable> must be of the form
	  <literal><replaceable>lang</replaceable>_<replaceable>COUNTRY</replaceable>.<replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable>@<replaceable>MODIFIER</replaceable></literal>,
	  where
	  <literal>_<replaceable>COUNTRY</replaceable></literal>,
	  <literal>.<replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable></literal>, 
	  and <literal>@<replaceable>MODIFIER</replaceable></literal>
	  may be omitted. If a postfixed key occurs, the same
	  key must be also present without the postfix.
    </para>
    <para>
      When reading in the desktop entry file, the value of the key is
      selected by matching the current POSIX locale for the
      <varname>LC_MESSAGES</varname> category against the
      <replaceable>LOCALE</replaceable> postfixes of all occurrences
      of the key, with the
      <literal>.<replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable></literal> part
      stripped.
    </para>
    <para>
	  The matching is done as follows.  If
	  <varname>LC_MESSAGES</varname> is of the form
	  <literal><replaceable>lang</replaceable>_<replaceable>COUNTRY</replaceable>.<replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable>@<replaceable>MODIFIER</replaceable></literal>, 
	  then it will match a key of the form
	  <literal><replaceable>lang</replaceable>_<replaceable>COUNTRY</replaceable>@<replaceable>MODIFIER</replaceable></literal>. 
	  If such a key does not exist, it will attempt to match
	  <literal><replaceable>lang</replaceable>_<replaceable>COUNTRY</replaceable></literal>
	  followed by
	  <literal><replaceable>lang</replaceable>@<replaceable>MODIFIER</replaceable></literal>.
	  Then, a match against <replaceable>lang</replaceable> by itself
	  will be attempted.  Finally, if no matching key is found the
	  required key without a locale specified is used.  The encoding
	  from the <varname>LC_MESSAGES</varname> value is ignored
	  when matching.
    </para>
    <para>
      If <varname>LC_MESSAGES</varname> does not have a <replaceable>MODIFIER</replaceable>
      field, then no key with a modifier will be matched.  Similarly, if
      <varname>LC_MESSAGES</varname> does not have a <replaceable>COUNTRY</replaceable>
      field, then no key with a country specified will be matched.  If
      <varname>LC_MESSAGES</varname> just has a <replaceable>lang</replaceable> field, then
      it will do a straight match to a key with a similar value.  The
      following table lists possible matches of various <varname>LC_MESSAGES</varname> values in
      the order in which they are matched.  Note that the
      <replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable> field isn't shown.

 Name=Foo

      Keys are either OPTIONAL or REQUIRED.  If a key is OPTIONAL it may or
      may not be present in the file.  However, if it isn't, the
      implementation of the standard should not blow up, it must provide
      some sane defaults.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some keys only make sense in the context when another particular key
      is also present and set to a specific value. Those keys should not be
      used if the particular key is not present or not set to the specific
      value. For example, the <varname>Terminal</varname> key can only be used
      when the value of the <varname>Type</varname> key is
      <constant>Application</constant>.
    </para>
    <para>
      If a REQUIRED key is only valid in the context of another key set to a
      specific value, then it has to be present only if the other key is set to
      the specific value. For example, the <varname>URL</varname> key has to be
      present when and only when when the value of the <varname>Type</varname>
      key is <constant>Link</constant>.

		  <varname>NoDisplay</varname> means "this application exists, but don't display it in the menus".
		  This can be useful to e.g. associate this application with MIME types, so that
		  it gets launched from a file manager (or other apps), without having a menu
		  entry for it (there are tons of good reasons for this, including e.g. the
		  <literal>netscape -remote</literal>, or <literal>kfmclient openURL</literal> kind of stuff).

		  <varname>Hidden</varname> should have been called <varname>Deleted</varname>.
		  It means the user deleted (at his level)
		  something that was present (at an upper level, e.g. in the system dirs). It's
		  strictly equivalent to the <filename>.desktop</filename> file not existing at all, as far as that user is
		  concerned. This can also be used to "uninstall" existing files (e.g. due to a renaming)
		  - by letting <literal>make install</literal> install a file with <literal>Hidden=true</literal> in it.

    <title>The <varname>Exec</varname> key</title>
    <para>
      The <varname>Exec</varname> key must contain a command line.
      A command line consists of an executable program optionally followed
      by one or more arguments.
      The executable program can either be specified with its full path or
      with the name of the executable only. If no full path is provided the
      executable is looked up in the $PATH environment variable used by the
      desktop environment.   
      The name or path of the executable program may not contain the equal
      sign ("="). Arguments are separated by a space.
    </para>
    <para>
      Arguments may be quoted in whole. If an argument contains a reserved
      character the argument must be quoted. The rules for quoting of
      arguments is also applicable to the executable name or path of the
      executable program as provided.
    </para>
    <para>
      Quoting must be done by enclosing the argument between double quotes
      and escaping the double quote character, backtick character ("`"),
      dollar sign ("$") and backslash character ("\") by preceding it with an
      additional backslash character. Implementations must undo quoting before
      expanding field codes and before passing the argument to the executable
      program. Reserved characters are space (" "), tab, newline, double
      quote, single quote ("'"), backslash character ("\"), 
      greater-than sign ("&gt;"), less-than sign ("&lt;"),
      tilde ("~"), vertical bar ("|"), ampersand ("&amp;"), semicolon (";"),
      dollar sign ("$"), asterisk ("*"), question mark ("?"), hash mark ("#"),
      parenthesis ("(") and (")") and backtick character ("`").
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that the general escape rule for values of type string states that
      the backslash character can be escaped as ("\\") as well and that this
      escape rule is applied before the quoting rule. As such, to
      unambiguously represent a literal backslash character in a quoted
      argument in a desktop entry file requires the use of four successive
      backslash characters ("\\\\"). Likewise, a literal dollar sign in a
      quoted argument in a desktop entry file is unambiguously represented
      with ("\\$").
    </para>
    <para>
      A number of special field codes have been defined which will be
      expanded by the file manager or program launcher when encountered
      in the command line.
      Field codes consist of the percentage character ("%") followed by
      an alpha character. Literal percentage characters must be escaped
      as <literal>%%</literal>.
      Deprecated field codes should be removed from the command line and
      ignored.
      Field codes are expanded only once, the string that is used to
      replace the field code should not be checked for field codes itself.
    </para>
    <para>
      Command lines that contain a field code that is not listed in this
      specification are invalid and must not be processed, in particular
      implementations may not introduce support for field codes not listed
      in this specification. Extensions, if any, should be introduced by
      means of a new key.
    </para>
    <para>
      Implementations must take care not to expand field codes into multiple
      arguments unless explicitly instructed by this specification.
      This means that name fields, filenames and other replacements that
      can contain spaces must be passed as a single argument
      to the executable program after expansion.
    </para>
    <para>
      Although the <varname>Exec</varname> key is defined to have a value
      of the type string, which is limited to ASCII characters, field code
      expansion may introduce non-ASCII characters in arguments.
      Implementations must take care that all characters in arguments
      passed to the executable program are properly encoded according to
      the applicable locale setting.

      <title>Caching MIME Types</title>
      <para>
	To make parsing of all the desktop files less costly, a
	<command>update-desktop-database</command> program is provided
	that will generate a cache file.  The concept is identical to
	that of the 'update-mime-database' program in that it lets
	applications avoid reading in (potentially) hundreds of files.
	It will need to be run after every desktop file is installed.
	One cache file is created for every directory in
	$XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications/, and will create a file called
	$XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications/mimeinfo.cache.
      </para>
      <para>
	The format of the cache is similar to that of the desktop file,
	and is just a list mapping mime-types to desktop files.  Here's
	a quick example of what it would look like:
      </para>
      <programlisting>application/x-foo=foo.desktop;bar.desktop;
application/x-bar=bar.desktop;</programlisting>
      <para>
	Each MIME Type is listed only once per cache file, and the
	desktop-id is expected to exist in that particular directory.
	That is to say, if the cache file is located at
	<filename>/usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache</filename>,
	bar.desktop refers to the file
	<filename>/usr/share/applications/bar.desktop</filename>.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="mime-priority">
      <title>Priority of MIME Types and desktop files</title>
      <para>
	There is also a preference list to determine preferred
	application of a given MIME Type.  It defines the 'default'
	application to handle a given MIME Type.  It has the same format
	as the cache list.
      </para>
      <programlisting>mime/type=desktop-id.desktop;</programlisting>
      <para>
	If a mime type is listed multiple times (either in the same
	file, or in another file further down the search path), the
	latter mention wins.  If a listed file doesn't exist, or is
	precluded through the <varname>OnlyShowIn</varname> or
	<varname>NotShowIn</varname> keys, they should be ignored.
	This means that applications will have to keep a history of the
	preferred applications that they run into, so that if the top
	desktop file for a given MIME Type isn't available, the second
	one can be tested, etc.
      </para>
      <para>
	It is also worth noting who this mechanism is defined for.  It
	is primarily intended for use by distributors/sysadmins to
	provide a sane set of defaults for their users.  Additionally,
	users themselves can use this mechanism to override the user
	defaults.  We intentionally don't provide a way for application
	authors themselves to list themselves as the default for a given
	type, as we felt that that cannot work.

        Application actions should be supported by implementors. However, in
        case they are not supported, implementors can simply ignore the
        <varname>Actions</varname> key and the associated <varname>Desktop
        Action</varname> action groups, and keep using the <varname>Desktop
        Entry</varname> group: the primary way to describe and invoke the
        application is through the Name, Icon and Exec keys from the
        <varname>Desktop Entry</varname> group.
      </para>
      <para>
        It is not expected that other desktop components showing application
        lists (software installers, for instance) will provide any user
        interface for these actions. Therefore applications must only include
        actions that make sense as general launchers.

      If the standard is to be amended with a new <literal>{key,value}</literal> pair which
      should be applicable to all supporting parties, a group discussion
      will take place.  This is the preferred method for introducing
      changes.  If one particular party wishes to add a field for personal
      use, they should prefix the key with the string <varname>X-<replaceable>PRODUCT</replaceable></varname>,
      e.g. <varname>X-NewDesktop-Foo</varname>, following the precedent set by other IETF and RFC
      standards.
    </para>
    <para>
      Alternatively, fields can be placed in their own group, where they may
      then have arbitrary key names.  If this is the case, the group should
      follow the scheme outlined above,
      i.e. <literal>[X-<replaceable>PRODUCT</replaceable>
      <replaceable>GROUPNAME</replaceable>]</literal> or
      something similar.  These steps will avoid namespace clashes between
      different yet similar environments.

  <appendix id="legacy-mixed">
    <title>The <constant>Legacy-Mixed</constant> Encoding (Deprecated)</title>
    <para>
      The <constant>Legacy-Mixed</constant> encoding corresponds to the
      traditional encoding of desktop files in older versions of the GNOME and
      KDE desktop files. In this encoding, the encoding of each
      <literal>localestring</literal> key is determined by the locale tag for
      that key, if any, instead of being UTF-8. For keys without a locale tag,
      the value must contain only ASCII characters.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the file specifies an unsupported encoding, the implementation
      should either ignore the file, or, if the user has requested a direct
      operation on the file (such as opening it for editing), display an
      appropriate error indication to the user.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the absence of an <varname>Encoding</varname> key, the implementation may choose
      to autodetect the encoding of the file by using such factors
      as:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The location of the file on the file system
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Whether the contents of the file are valid UTF-8
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      If the implementation does not perform such auto-detection, it should
      treat a file without an <varname>Encoding</varname> key in the same way as a file with an
      unsupported <varname>Encoding</varname> key.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the locale tag includes an <literal>.<replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable></literal> part, then that determines
      the encoding for the line. Otherwise, the encoding is determined
      by the language, or
      <literal><replaceable>lang</replaceable>_<replaceable>COUNTRY</replaceable></literal>
      pair from the locale tag, according to the following table.

      This table above covers all tags and encodings that are known to
      be currently in use. Implementors may choose to support
      encodings not in the above set. For tags without defaults listed
      in the above table, desktop file creators must specify the
      <literal>.<replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable></literal> part of the locale tag.
    </para>
    <para>
      Matching the <literal>.<replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable></literal> part of the locale tag against a locale
      name or alias should be done by stripping all punctuation
      characters from both the tag and the name or alias, converting
      both name and alias to lowercase, and comparing the result.
      This is necessary because, for example, <literal>Big5</literal> is frequently
      found instead of <literal>BIG5</literal> and <literal>georgianacademy</literal> instead of
      <literal>GEORGIAN-ACADEMY</literal>. Desktop files creators should, however, use
      the name as it appears in the "Encoding" column above.
