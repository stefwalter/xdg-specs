  
  Selection target _NET_MAX_SELECTION_SIZE

  When a client encounters target _NET_MAX_SELECTION_SIZE in
 SelectionRequest event, it should use its value as a limit for the
 following targets in the same request (i.e. the request should be of type
 MULTIPLE). The
 _NET_MAX_SELECTION_SIZE target should be always the first target in the
 MULTIPLE request.

  The target _NET_MAX_SELECTION_SIZE is a side-effect target, as described
 in ICCCM section 2.6.3. When handling this target, the matching property on
 the requestor window should be of type XA_INTEGER, format 32, with 2
 elements.

  If the selection owner's connection to the X server is local, the first
 element is used as the limit, otherwise the second element is used as the
 limit. A local connection is identified by a value of XDisplayString() with
 the first character ':', for example, ":0.0". A value of -1 for either
 element means no limit.

  The value should limit the sum of the sizes in the request, not separately
 each of them. The client should reject subsequent targets if they would
 cause the total amount of data transferred for all targets to exceed the
 limit. Note that there is no requirement that if one target is rejected,
 all other targets will be rejected or all that subsequent targets will be
 rejected.

  Clients are not required to limit the data size precisely to the given
 value. If the computation of the data size would be expensive for the
 client, a certain reasonable inaccurancy is allowed. In other words, if the
 client for various reasons doesn't know exact size of the data to be
 transfered, it should try to estimate it, rather than transfering data with
 size that is possibly magnitudes larger.

 The intent of this target is to avoid unwanted large transfers, so it
 should be requsted only by xclipboard-like tools. They should use a request
 of type MULTIPLE with _NET_MAX_SELECTION_SIZE as the first target in the
 MULTIPLE request, with the requested target(s) after it.
